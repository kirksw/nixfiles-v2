# NixFiles v2.0

## Overview

I wanted better handling of both mac and nix clients, as the initial config was target intitally to nixos and was extended to mac over time.

## TODO

- [ ] add overlay example (neovim-nightly)
- [ ] reimplement darwin dock setup
- [ ] correctly setup config for nixos host
