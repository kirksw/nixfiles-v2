# SWE-Pruner MCP Tools

Use this skill when reading large code files or searching codebases to reduce context window usage.

## When to Use

- Reading files larger than 500 lines
- Searching codebases with many matches
- Context budget is constrained
- User asks to "prune", "reduce tokens", or "focus on relevant code"
- Exploring unfamiliar large files

## Available Tools

### `read_pruned(file_path, context_focus_question?)`

Read a file with optional context-aware pruning.

**Parameters:**
- `file_path` (required): Absolute path to the file
- `context_focus_question` (optional): Question guiding what code to keep

**Examples:**
```
# Full file (no pruning)
read_pruned(file_path="/path/to/main.py")

# Pruned to relevant sections
read_pruned(
  file_path="/path/to/auth.py",
  context_focus_question="How is JWT validation implemented?"
)
```

### `search_pruned(pattern, context_focus_question?)`

Search codebase with optional context-aware pruning.

**Parameters:**
- `pattern` (required): Regex pattern to search
- `context_focus_question` (optional): Question guiding which matches to keep

**Examples:**
```
# Search without pruning
search_pruned(pattern="class.*Service")

# Search with pruning
search_pruned(
  pattern="func.*Handler",
  context_focus_question="Which handlers process HTTP requests?"
)
```

## Pruning Behavior

1. **No query provided**: Returns full content (no pruning)
2. **Query + model available**: Uses ML-based line relevance scoring
3. **Query + no model**: Falls back to heuristic pruning
4. **Failure**: Automatically returns full content

## Best Practices

1. **Start specific**: Use focused questions like "How is error handling done?" rather than "show me everything"
2. **Chain searches**: Use search_pruned to find files, then read_pruned to dive deeper
3. **Check stats**: View `$HOME/.cache/swe-pruner/stats.json` to see compression ratios
4. **Model availability**: Heuristic fallback works without model files

## Performance Notes

- Token savings: 23-54% average
- First ML-backed call: slow (model load)
- Heuristic fallback: fast, always available
- Subsequent calls: fast (model cached)

## Workflow Integration

1. Use `search_pruned` to locate relevant files
2. Use `read_pruned` with focused questions on large files
3. If results are insufficient, call again without question for full content
4. Check stats file to verify pruning effectiveness
